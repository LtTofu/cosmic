# libs

Libraries modified for use in the application. It is recommended to update
the other dependencies to their latest version before building. See full
deps list and attribution in /docs/.

Building against different versions of the CUDA Toolkit will produce builds
which require a compatible range of CUDA runtimes (included with the nVidia
Graphics drivers. CUDA Toolkit is not needed to run the miner.)
